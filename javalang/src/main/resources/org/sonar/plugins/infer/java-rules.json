The issue is about a pointer that can be `null` and it is dereferenced. This leads to a crash in all the above languages.\n### Null dereference in C\nHere is an example of an inter-procedural null dereference bug in C:\n### Null dereference in Objective-C\nIn Objective-C, null dereferences are less common than in Java, but they still happen and their cause can be hidden. In general, passing a message to nil does not cause a crash and returns `nil`, but dereferencing a pointer directly does cause a crash as well as calling a `nil` block.C\nMoreover, there are functions from the libraries that do not allow `nil` to be passed as argument. Here are some examples:\n### Null dereference in Java\nMany of Infer s reports of potential NPE s come from code of the form\nIf you see code of this form, then you have several options.\n If you are unsure whether or not foo() will return null , you should ideally i. Change the code to ensure that foo() can not return null ii. Add a check for whether p is null, and do something other than dereferencing p when it is null.\nSometimes, in case ii it is not obvious what you should do when p is null. One possibility (a last option) is to throw an exception, failing early. This can be done using checkNotNull as in the following code:\nThe call checkNotNull(foo()) will never return null; in case foo() returns null it fails early by throwing an NPE.\n If you are absolutely sure that foo() will not be null , then if you land your diff this case will no longer be reported after your diff makes it to master. In the future we might include analysis directives (hey, analyzer, p is not null!) like in Hack that tell the analyzer the information that you know, but that is for later.\n",

    "description": "Reported as Resource LeakResource Leak by biabduction.\nInfer reports resource leaks in C, Objective-C and Java. In general, resources are entities such as files, sockets, connections, etc, that need to be closed after being used.\n### Resource leak in C\nThis is an example of a resource leak in C code:\n### Resource leak in Java\nFor the remaining of this section, we will consider examples of resource leaks in Java code.\nTIP: A common source of bugs is exceptions skipping past close() statements. That is the first thing to look for if INFER reports a potential resource leak.\n### Basics and Standard Idiom\nSome objects in Java, the resources, are supposed to be closed when you stop using them, and failure to close is a resource leak. Resources include input streams, output streams, readers, writers, sockets, http connections, cursors, and json parsers.\nThe standard idiom is\nor more for example,\nand you should use the standard idiom for the most part, when you don t want to return the resource to the surrounding context.\nSometimes people just leave out close(), and that is a bug, but more typically exceptional paths are the root of the problem, as in\nwhere an exception in fos.write will cause execution to skip past the close() statement.\n#### Multiple Resources Bugs\nWe can deal with multiple resources correctly and simply just by nesting the standard idiom.\nBugs often occur when using multiple resources in other ways because of exceptions in close() methods. For example,\nHere, if there is an exception in the call to fis.close() execution will skip past fos.close(); a leak.\nAnother way, besides the standard idiom, to deal with this problem is to swallow exceptions.\nYou can also swallow the exception on the output stream. Some people prefer not to swallow output stream exceptions, and also flush before closing. http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1118\nNotice that the nested standard idiom does not need the checks for null, which are in there in this case to protect against the case when one of the allocations throws an exception, in which case one would get a NullPointerException.\n### Nested_Allocations\nWhen a resource allocation is included as an argument to a constructor, if the constructor fails it can leave an an unreachable resource that no one can close.\nFor example gzipOutputStream = new GZIPOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(out)); is bad in case the outer constructor, GZIPOutputStream, throws an exception. In that case, no one will have a hold of the FileOutputStream and so no one will be able to close it.\nIn such a case you need to move the allocation the FileOutputStream out of the nested position and name it, so you are able to close if anything goes wrong during execution of the GZIPOutputStream constructor.\nHere are resources that can throw exceptions i their constructor(s).\n - ObjectInputStream , ObjectOutputStream, PipedInputStream, PipedOutputStream,  PipedReader, PipedWriter, JarInputStream, JarOutputStream, GZIPInputStream,  GZIPOutputStream , ZipFile all throw IOException\n - PrintStream throws UnsupportedEncodingException\nThe constructors for FileInputStream, FileOutputStream and RandomAccessFile throw FileNotFoundException, but these cases are not problematic in the sense that their arguments are not resources and so they do not cause the nested resource leak.\n### Allocation of JSonParser and Cursor resources\nSome resources are created inside libraries instead of by newnew.\nCursor is an interface, the actual resources are something like SQLiteCursor. So, every time you call a function that returns a Cursor object, there is an allocation.\nFor instance, in the functions from SQLiteDatabase query(…) and rawQuery(…) allocate a cursor resource. For SQLiteQueryBuilder, ContentProviderClient, ContentResolver. MediaStore and DownloadManager it is only query(…) Cursor objects cursor created by these functions need to be closed (i.e., cursor.close()).\nSimilarly, JsonParser is an abstract class, and create a resource in functions from the class JsonFactory createParser(byte[] data) createParser(byte[] data, int offset, int len) createParser(String content) createParser(URL url) createParser(File f) JsonParser objects js created by these functions need to be closed (jp.close()). On the other hand . JasonParsers gotten from createParser(InputStream in) and createParser(Reader r) give you JsonParsers that don’t need to be closed. This is because they receive the resource from somewhere that will maintain the responsibility to close it.\n### Escaping resources and exceptions\nSometimes you want to return a resource to the outside, in which case you should not close it, but you still need to be careful of exceptions in case control skips past the return leaving no one to close. Here is a simple example of a positive use of escaping resources.\nIn this case it is intended that an object that wraps `stream` is passed to the caller of `createAttachment`. You should certainly not close stream here, because it is being passed to the outside.\nBut for escaping resources like this you still need to be careful of exceptions. For example, in\nif stream.write(7) throws an exception, then no one will have a hold of stream, and no one will be able to close it; a leak.\n### Java 7s try-with-resources\n(For use with Java 7 only)\nClearly, accounting for the ramifications of all the exceptional cases is complicated, and there is a better way in Java 7.\nAll the complicated exceptional cases above are (apparently) covered by this construct, and the result is much simpler.\nSo, if you are trying to fix a potential leak in code with multiples resources you can go ahead and try to understand whether the potential leak is real. Or, if the code is complex and it is hard to figure out, it would be perfectly legitimate to simply convert the code over to try-with-resources if you have access to Java 7, so as to save yourself some brain-cycles. You will also end up with cleaner code.\nIf try-with-resources is so great you should always use it. But you shouldn t… Try-with-resources gives resources static scoping, and works via a stack discipline. Sometimes, you want a resource to persist beyond scope, as in the escaping example above. In an escaping example maybe you could refactor lots of code so that try-with-resources applies, and maybe you cannot in a sensible way. This just illustrates that, though you might hear people say that try-with-resources solvessolves the resource problem, it does not. It is very useful, but you cannot use it blindly when you see a resource-allocation site.\n",

The analyser is called RacerD and this section gives brief but a mostly complete description of its features. See the RacerD page for more in-depth information and examples.\n### Thread-safety: What is a data race\nHere a data race is a pair of accesses to the same member field such that:\n - at least one is a write, and,\n - at least one occurs without any lock synchronization, and,\n - the two accesses occur on threads (if known) which can run in parallel.\n### Thread-safety: Potential fixes\n - Synchronizing the accesses (using the `synchronized` keyword, thread-exclusion  such as atomic objects, `volatile` etc).\n - Making an offending method private   this will exclude it from being checked  at the top level, though it will be checked if called by a public method which  may itself, e.g., hold a lock when calling it.\n - Putting the two accesses on the same thread, e.g., by using `@MainThread` or  `@ThreadConfined`.\n### Thread-safety: Conditions checked before reporting\nThe class and method are not marked `@ThreadSafe(enableChecks = false)`, and,\n - The method is declared `synchronized`, or employs (non-transitively) locking,  or,\n - The class is not marked `@NotThreadSafe`, and,\n - The class/method is marked `@ThreadSafe,` or one of the configured synonyms in `.inferconfig`, or,\n - A parent class, or an override method are marked with the above annotations.\nNB currently RacerD does not take into account `@GuardedBy`.\n### Thread-safety: Thread annotations recognized by RacerD\nThese class and method annotations imply the method is on the main thread: `@MainThread`, `@UiThread`\nThese method annotations imply the method is on the main thread: `@OnBind`, `@OnEvent`, `@OnMount`, `@OnUnbind`, `@OnUnmount`\nBoth classes of annotations work through the inheritance tree (i.e. if a parent class or method is marked with one of these annotations, so is the child class / method override).\nIn addition to these, RacerD recognizes many lifecycle methods as necessarily running on the main thread, eg `Fragment.onCreate` etc.\nFinally, the thread status of being on the main thread propagates backwards through the call graph (ie if `foo` calls `bar` and `bar` is marked `@UiThtread` then `foo` is automatically considered on the main thread too). Calling `assertMainThread`, `assertOnUiThread`, `checkOnMainThread` has the same effect.\nNB RacerD currently does not recognize `@WorkerThread`, `@BinderThread` or `@AnyThread`.\n### Thread-safety: Other annotations and what they do\nThese annotations can be found at `com.facebook.infer.annotation.*`.\n - `@Functional` This is a method annotation indicating the method always returns  the same value. When a method `foo` is annotated `@Functional`, RacerD will  ignore any writes of the return value of `foo`. For example, in  `this.x = foo()`, the write to `this.x` is ignored. The reasoning is that if  the method returns the same value whenever it s called, any data race on  `this.x` is benign, if that is the only write.\n - `@ThreadConfined` This is a class/method/field annotation which takes a single  parameter which can be `UI`, `ANY` or a user chosen string. It indicates to  RacerD a thread identifier for the class/method/field. Thus,  `@ThreadConfined(UI)` is equivalent to `@UiThread`, and `@ThreadConfined(ANY)`  is equivalent to not having the annotation at all, for classes and methods.  When this annotation is applied to a field it instructs Infer to assume  (without checking) that all accesses to that field are made on the same thread  (and can, therefore, not race by definition). The intention is that RacerD  uses that to detect exclusion between accesses occurring on the same thread.  However, only the UI thread is supported at this time, and any user provided  value is considered equal to `UI`.\n - `@VisibleForTesting` A method annotation making Infer consider the method as  effectively `private`. This means it will not be checked for races against  other non-private methods of the class, but only if called by one.\n - `@ReturnsOwnership` A method annotation indicating that the method returns a  freshly owned object. Accesses to the returned value will not be considered  for data races, as the object is in-effect unique and not accessible yet from  other threads. The main utility of this annotation is in interfaces, where  Infer cannot look up the implementation and decide for itself.\n",

Note that the integer of RHS can be 0, which is safe.\n - `L5`: The reports that are not included in the above cases.\n - `U5`: A binary integer operation is unsafe by unknown values, which are usually from unknown function calls.\n",
